README - FPyL

Project Description
For my term project, I will be making a Fantasy Premier League helper app, FPyL. This app is designed to aid users in making selections for their teams in the official Fantasy Premier League (abbreviated FPL) game (For more info on what Fantasy Premier League is and the rules of the official game, see https://fantasy.premierleague.com/help/rules). The premise of Fantasy Premier League is simple: pick the soccer players who do the best in real life matches for your team in order to get the most points in the fantasy game. Picking the correct players can be very difficult, in large part due to the sheer amount of luck and uncertainty that is inherent to sports, especially soccer. My app attempts to remove some of this uncertainty by using quantitative data to help users select their optimal lineup (and hopefully win a trip to London in the process).

How To Run This Project
Run FPL.py in your editor to set up the player data pickle (.p) files, then run App.py in your editor and the app should pop up.

Libraries Required
PIL - Image editing
requests - connection with FPL API and webscraping
Pafy - for finding and downloading highlights from YouTube
Unidecode - for parsing accented text
OpenCV, numpy - for viewing highlights
sklearn - for player points prediction
